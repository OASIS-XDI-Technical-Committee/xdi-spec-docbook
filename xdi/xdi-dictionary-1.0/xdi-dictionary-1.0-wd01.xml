    <title>XDI Reserved terms</title>
    <para>The following are dictionary terms that are formally defined in other XDI specifications,
      but are collected here for reference.</para>

    <section id="d.key">
      <title>$key Reserved Dictionary Term</title>
      <para>The <code>$key</code> reserved term is used to declare a literal is a cryptographic
        key.</para>
    </section>
<section id="d.mime">
  <title>$mime Reserved Dictionary Term</title>
  <para>The $mime term is a requied property when encrypting literals in XDI messages. $mime is used to inform a message recipient the type of media that has been encrpyted (for example, image/png). Valid values for the $mime term as described in [rfc????] and as registered with [IANA]. Use of proprietary mime types is discoraged, as this may result in message recipients in ability to process the message completely. Clients which do not support the stated media type MUST NOT decrypt the value of a literal.</para>
</section>
    
    <section id="d.x509">
      <title>$x509 Reserved Dictionary Term</title>
      <para>The <code>$x509</code> term indicates that the corresponding literal is either a URL
        refering to a PEM or DER encoded x509 certificate, or that the PEM or DER encoded
        certificate is included in the subject graph.</para>

      <section>
        <title>$der Key Encoding</title>
        <para>The <code>$der</code> term indicates a key located in the graph is DER encoded <xref linkend="DER"/>.</para>
